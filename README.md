McHack_Castaway
===============

McGill Hackathon application, Castaway.

You don't need data to get directions.

Our app allows you to get directions (walking, biking, driving, or public transit) from your phone without using data or wifi.

While our app provides a nice interface for android users, the service is available to all phones by texting "(method of transport) from (start location) to (destination)" to +12892733720
